# Phylogenetics Group Project

## Introduction

Time to test out what you've learnt on a new dataset! 

The dataset you'll be working on can be found in `~/Phylogenetics/BA2_subsampled.fasta`

This dataset consists of sequences from the BA2 SARS-CoV-2 lineage.

Try to use the skills you've learnt to answer the following questions:

1. How many sequences are in this dataset?
2. What is the best fitting model? What do the parameters mean?
3. What initial observations can you make from the tree topology? Which sequence(s) show the most divergence?
4. What do the bootstrap values tell us about this tree?
5. What format are the sequence IDs in? What information can we extract from them?

##FINAL TEST:
Create a publication ready image of the maximum likelihood tree of these sequences, with tips coloured by region and only bootstrap values of at least 70 shown. Include an appropriate figure legend. 

## Additional activity

Extract the dates from the sequence IDs and make a txt file with the date for each ID, similar to what we've done before.

Import the tree and dates into Tempest.
Hint: The date format may be different to last time!

1. Does this dataset show a temporal signal? What evidance do you have for/against this?
2. What is the estimated date of the MRCA?
3. What is the estimated evolutionary rate?
4. Which sequences show greater divergence than expected? Which show less divergence?
